In this project, we aim to predict a business's stars rating using the reviews of that business and review
count based on neural network implementation in Tensorflow. This project is twofold:

• Task 1: Consider this problem as a regression problem. Compare the RMSE of the BEST
Tensorflow regression neural network model you obtained with that of regression model you
achieved in the last project.

• Task 2: Consider this problem as a classification problem. Compare the accuracy of the BEST
Tensorflow classification neural network model you obtained with that of each classification
model you achieved in the last project.
